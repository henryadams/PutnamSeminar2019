\section{Introduction}

A recent conjecture states that the clique complex of any unit disk graph is a wedge of spheres (up to homotopy type).
\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:main}
The clique complex of any unit disk graph is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of spheres.
\end{conjecture}
An equivalent formulation is that the Vietoris--Rips complex of any set of points in the plane is a wedge of spheres.
We will survey what is known and not known about this conjecture, and also describe some related computational experiments.


\section{Project Overview}

The wikipedia article \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cop-win\_graph} explains a game of pursuit evasion on a graph $G$, where a robber is trying to evade a cop. 
We say that a graph $G$ is \emph{cop-win} if, no matter where the cop and robber are placed initially, the cop can always catch the robber.

It turns out that a graph $G$ is a cop-win graph if and only if it is \emph{dismantlable}, which we will describe in Section~\ref{sec:cop-win}.
Roughly speaking, a graph is dismantlable if you can ``remove dominated vertices" until you end up with only a single vertex.
More generally, after you have removed as many dominated vertices as possible, the resulting graph is called a \emph{minimal core}. Surprisingly, it turns out that all possible minimal cores of a graph are isomorphic to each other.

In this project, we will study the minimal cores of unit disk graphs.
A unit disk graph is a very particular type of graph which is formed by selecting a finite set of vertices in the plane $\R^2$, and then connecting two vertices by an edge if and only if the Euclidean distance between them is at most one.

The minimal cores of unit disk graphs from points on the circle are already classified.
Roughly speaking, one of our main questions will be to explore whether unit disk graphs from points in $\R^2$ are ``simple combinations" of unit disk graphs from points on the circle, or if the unit disk graphs from arbitrary points in $\R^2$ can exhibit ``wildly new phenomena."

One of our first tasks will be to learn the basics of cop-win graphs.

A major task will be to write software that can accept an arbitrary graph as input, and then as output return a minimal core.
We can test this software on unit disk graphs from the circle.
We will then use this software to visualize unit disk graphs of points in $\R^2$.

A later task will be to learn a little bit of combinatorial topology.
Part of the motivation for this project is to prove or disprove the conjecture that ``the clique complex of the unit disk graph of any finite set of points in $\R^2$ is always homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of spheres", whatever in the world that means!

\section{Cop-win graphs}\label{sec:cop-win}

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple undirected graph (no loops or multiple edges) with $V$ the set of vertices and with $E$ the set of edges.

For any vertex $v\in V$, let $N[v]=\{v\}\cup\{u\in V~|~uv\in E\}$ be the \emph{closed neighborhood} of $v$ (where ``closed" implies that the vertex $v$ is itself included in this neighborhood).
\begin{definition}\label{def:dominated}
In a graph $G$, we say that a vertex $v$ is \emph{dominated} by a vertex $u$ if $N[v]\subseteq N[u]$.
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{Dominated1_labeled.pdf}
\caption{Vertex $v$ is dominated by vertex $u$.}
\label{fig:dominated}
\end{figure}

%Let $G\setminus u$ be the graph obtained by deleting $u$ and all of the edges containing $u$.

If you iteratively remove dominated vertices from a graph $G$, then your final ending configuration (once there are no more remaining dominated vertices) is called a \emph{minimal core}.
An important fact is that all minimal cores of a graph are isomorphic.

We say that a graph $G$ is \emph{dismantlable} if its minimal core is a single vertex, or equivalently, if one can remove dominated vertices one-by-one until only a single vertex remains.
A second important fact is that a graph is a cop-win graph if and only if it is dismantlable.



\section{Algorithms for computing minimal cores}
See \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cop-win\_graph} for some information on algorithms computing the minimal core of a graph.
What software options are out there, and should we write our own?
The main place to look is google!
Two other places to look are sage and polymake.

I claim that if we wish to implement it ourselves, the ``right'' way to do it is to implement the graph data structure in \url{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397511009662?via\%3Dihub}, because it will help time bounds greatly for finding dominated vertices.  It does look kinda complicated, but that paper has everything we would need. 

\note{Todo Henry: Share a mathematica demo for Vietoris--Rips complexes!}

% Useless trivia: If you remove a dominated vertex from a graph, no dominated vertices will become un-dominated.  However, new dominated vertices \emph{may} be created.  Thus, a simple greedy algorithm (e.g. while there exists a dominated vertex, remove it) will not return incorrect results.


\section{Unit disk graphs}

Let $\R^2$ be the euclidean plane, and for any two points $u,v\in\R^2$, let $d(u,v)$ denote the Euclidean distance between them.

\begin{definition}
Let $V \subseteq \R^2$ be a subset of the plane.
The \emph{unit disk graph} $G(V)$ is the graph $G$ with vertex set $V$, in $u,v$ are the vertices of an edge in $G(V)$ if and only if $d(u,v) \leq 1$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Given a metric space $X$ and a distance threshold $r>0$, the \emph{Vietoris-Rips simplicial complex} $\textbf{VR}_{<}(X;r)$ has as its simplices the finite subsets of $X$ of diameter less than $r$. It is determined by its 1-skeleton (its underlying graph), and is the clique complex of the unit disk graph.
\end{definition}

\note{Does somebody want to write software that will accept as input a set of points in the plane, compute its unit disk graph, collapse it down to a minimal core (perhaps using Ethan's software), and then plot the minimal core in the plane?}



\section{Minimal cores of unit disk graphs on the circle}

\note{These are classifiable---we will describe.}

\note{Does somebody want to take a stab at describing these ``$C_n^k$" graphs?}

\begin{definition}
The graph $C_n^k$ has $n$ vertices, $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$. There is an edge $v_iv_j$ iff $|i - j| \leq k$.
\end{definition}

\section{Minimal cores of unit disk graphs in the plane}

\note{This is where we will be doing much of our initial exploring/work!}



\section{Questions}

Are the minimal cores of unit disk graphs in the plane ``simple combinations" of unit disk graphs from points on the circle, or can they exhibit ``wildly new phenomena"?

\note{After experiments, we may find some new phenomena that we try to collapse down via other techniques --- see Section~\ref{sec:collapse}.}



\section{Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations}

\note{Does somebody want to start briefly describing Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations?
Steal (and cite) an image from wikipedia, as done also in Figure~\ref{fig:simplicialComplex}. The point is that these may guide which parts of the complex we try to collapse.}

\section{The topological perspective}

Recall that a graph is a collection of vertices (0-dimensional pieces) and edges (1-dimensional pieces) that are ``glued-together compatibly".
What if we now also allow triangles (2-dimensional pieces), tetrahedra (3-dimensional pieces), etc? The resulting object is called a \emph{simplicial complex}; see for example \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial\_complex}. 
Instead of calling these pieces vertices, edges, triangles, tetrahedra, etc, we can more efficiently call them $k$-simplices, where $k$ is the dimension of the piece!
For example, a vertex is a 0-simplex, an edge is a 1-simplex, a triangle is a 2-simplex, and a tetrahedron is a 3-simplex. Note that a $k$-simplex is a $k$-dimensional building block consisting of $k+1$ vertices. The advantage of this notation is that now we can also talk about $k$-simplices for any $k\ge 0$!
Though some definitions of simplicial complexes feel a little abstract, the right perspective is to think of a simplicial complex as a LEGO set that is formed by gluing simple building blocks (simplices) together!

\begin{definition}
A \emph{simplicial complex} $K$ on a vertex set $V$ is a set of simplices $\sigma \subseteq V$, such that if $\sigma\in K$ (meaning $\sigma$ is a simplex in the complex) and $\tau\subseteq\sigma$ (meaning $\tau$ is a face of $\sigma$), then we also have $\tau\in K$ (meaning that $\tau$ is also a simplex in the complex).
\footnote{Strictly speaking, if we we want to say that $V$ is the vertex set of $K$, then we should also specify that each singleton element of $V$ is a simplex in $K$.}
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[h]

\hspace{20mm}

\caption{(Left) A simplicial complex. (Right) A clique complex.
Note the leftmost figure is not a clique complex since it has an empty triangle!
Both figures are from Wikipedia.}
\label{fig:simplicialComplex}
\end{figure}

A \emph{clique complex} is a way to build a simplicial complex on top of a graph; see for example \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique\_complex}.
More specifically, let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple undirected graph (no loops or multiple edges) with $V$ the set of vertices and with $E$ the set of edges.

\begin{definition}
The \emph{clique complex $\cl(G)$} of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is the largest simplicial complex that has $V$ as its set of vertices and $E$ as its set of edges.
That is, $\cl(G)$ contains $\{v_0,\ldots,v_k\}\subseteq V$ as a simplex if $v_iv_j\in E$ (i.e.\ if $v_iv_j$ is an edge in $G$) for all $0\le i,j\le k$.
\end{definition}

\note{Notice that the clique complex of the unit disk graph is the Vietoris-Rips complex of its vertex set with $\delta = 1$, equipped with the Euclidean metric - Andrew}

Recall from Definition~\ref{def:dominated} that in a graph $G$ there is a notion of when one vertex \emph{dominates} another.
It turns out that if $u$ is a dominated vertex, then removing $u$ from $G$ doesn't affect ``the shape" of the clique complex of $G$ in any significant way!
More precisely, if $v$ is a dominated vertex, and if $G\setminus v$ is the graph obtained by removing vertex $v$, then we have a ``homotopy equivalence" of clique complexes $\cl(G)\simeq \cl(G\setminus v)$.
This means that $\cl(G)$ and $\cl(G\setminus v)$ are ``the same shape", topologically speaking.
See Figure~\ref{fig:dominatedClique}.\footnote{The ``fancy" explanation for why $\cl(G)$ and $\cl(G\setminus v)$ have the same shape, topologically speaking, is because the ``link" of $v$ (drawn in blue in Figure~\ref{fig:dominatedClique}) is contractible (it is a cone with apex $u$).}.

\label{fig:dominatedClique}
\end{figure}

Some references for dominated vertices are \cite{BabsonKozlov2006,barmak2012strong,Matouvsek2008}, although those references are perhaps way more complicated than what we need (the notion of dominated vertices for arbitrary simplicial complexes is more complicated than that for clique complexes).


\section{Questions involving topology}

If the clique complex is ever not a wedge sum of spheres, then we have disproved an open conjecture!

If the clique complexes are always wedges of spheres, then by analyzing their cores, we may gain insight on how to prove this conjecture.

In the minimal cores that we generate, are all of the homology generators easy to interpret (using what's known on the circle)?



\section{Other notions of ``collapse" in topology}\label{sec:collapse}

(Besides removing dominated vertices)

Last meeting (2/11/19) we talked about the idea that removing dominated vertices may not be enough to fully understand our conjecture. Here is a list of other homotopy-preserving operations that may or may not be of use to us. Many of these relate to the Vietoris-Rips complex, which is a generalization of the unit disk graph. In particular, when our points are sampled from $\R^2$ equipped with the Euclidean metric and $\delta=1$, the Vietoris-Rips complex is the clique complex of the unit disk graph.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{$\varepsilon$-Crushing} \\
Given a Vietoris-Rips complex, how else can we remove vertices in a homotopy preserving way? One answer may be $\varepsilon$-crushing, highlighted in the article by Latschev~\cite{Latschev2001}.
In particular, the flat case in section 2 may be of use. 
If anyone could determine whether or not this can help us simplify our complexes or if it is simply a generalization of removing dominated vertices, that would be helpful!
\item \textbf{The Rips Shadow} \\
Another way to simplify the Vietoris-Rips complex is to calculate its shadow, or its projection down onto the plane.
The article by Chambers gives isomorphisms between certain homotopy groups of the Rips complex and its shadow~\cite{Chambers2008}. It also includes algorithms for computing the shadow, for those who are more programming-minded.
\item \textbf{s-Dismantlability} \\
In a general flag or clique complex, where every simplex corresponds to a complete subgraph of its 1-skeleton, we can define a notion of s-dismantlability.
A vertex $v_i$ is considered \textit{s-dismantlable} in $G$ if the subgraph $N_{G}(v_i)$ of the neighbourhood of $v_i$ is dismantlable.
Boulet et al.\ show that s-dismantlability can be used to define more homotopy preserving collapses such as edge deletion, even if the vertex isn't dominated~\cite{Boulet2010}.
\item \textbf{Other Elementary Collapses} \\
In a simplicial complex, there are other operations that collapse edges and vertices while preserving homotopy types. Attali et al.\ begin by defining an \textit{elementary collapse} as a method of removing two vertices, then generalize it to \textit{classical collapses, extended collapses} and \textit{generalized collapses}~\cite{Attali2013}.
They then apply these collapses in certain orders to define various reduction sequences for common cases.
\item Simplicial collapses (\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse\_(topology)}})
\item \textbf{``Punctured" simplices} \\
Let's consider the context of this paper, where $X\subseteq \R^2$, and where we're trying to simplify $\cl(G(X))=VR(X;1)$. If $\sigma\subseteq X$ is maximal, then consider the subset $\sigma_0\subseteq \sigma$ of vertices that live on the boundary of the convex hull of $\sigma$. 
Then $\sigma_0$ is contained in a unique maximal face (namely $\sigma$), and hence we can perform a simplicial collapse (in the bullet point above) to remove all simplices $\tau$ with $\sigma_0\subseteq \tau\subseteq \sigma$. Do this for all such maximal simplices (keeping in mind that as we remove simplices, now new simplices become maximal). 
Iterate this. Afterwards, I think we are left only with ``unpunctured simplices", meaning only simplices with no vertices in the interiors of their convex hull. 
\item \textbf{``Long edges"} \\
After removing all punctured simplices as in the above bullet point, we still have a lot of long edges (note edges are punctured with probability zero, i.e.\ edges are never punctured if the points are in general position).
Is there a nice way to remove these long edges?
As a starting case, think of two long crossing diagonal edges (of a quadrilateral) which hence form a tetrahedron --- can we use this tetrahedron to collapse away one of these two long edges, getting down instead to two triangles?
\end{itemize}
