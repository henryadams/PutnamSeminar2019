The file VietorisRipsAndCech.nb allows you to compute the Vietoris-Rips complex even as you move points around, vary the scale, etc.
It requires having Mathematica installed.

Other Mathematica demos **do not** require you to have Mathematica installed.

This is a .cdf file instead of a .nb file, which means you can download a free .cdf player to use it (you are given this option after downloading the file from the above html link).
